# PWS
Ping, WoL, Stats

A bit of context.
I am unable to wake on lan (WoL) devices at home due to the way my ISP's router is setup.
I could get a router and put the ISP's into modem mode, but I thought it would be more fun
to learn how to code in Python to create a little program that would allow me to do this.

I am working on this in stages, since I have little to now functional experience with programming.<br>

-First, create a module that allows me to ping devices on my network as this will give me some feedback

-Second, I will work on the WoL module so I can go ahead and wake those pesky devices.

-Third, I want to try and setup a dashboard of types so I can monitor different processes on certain devices.

I then plan on loading that onto my Raspberry Pi as the host.

If this sounds really noobish or has already been done then I appologise, I just want to give it ago for shits and giggles!
